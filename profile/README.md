# What is Refugee Pal?
Refugee Pal is a comprehensive mobile application designed to provide aid and assistance to refugees residing in Canada. The application is compatible with various operating systems, including iOS, Android and web, as well as diverse screen sizes, offering users a seamless experience regardless of their device of choice.

The app is developed using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework, a dynamic and powerful combination that enables us to create a smooth and efficient user interface. To accelerate the development process, we leveraged the benefits of FlutterFlow, a no-code builder that helped us streamline our workflow and expedite the app's delivery.

Furthermore, Refugee Pal's backend infrastructure is built on Firebase, a secure and reliable cloud-based platform that allows us to manage and store data with ease. With its cutting-edge technology and robust features, Firebase ensures that the app functions smoothly and efficiently, providing a seamless experience for our users.

# üñ•Ô∏è Our Features

## üíª Digital Resource Hub:
The digital resource hub is designed to provide refugees in Canada with easy-to-understand and categorized information. It includes a comprehensive library of information with various categories such as employment, learning English, housing, culture and community, settlement, financial, healthcare, legal services, and mental health. Each category has subcategories and detailed topics with links and redirects to relevant and reliable sources. The platform aims to solve multiple problems faced by refugees by providing them with valuable information that can help them with challenges related to employment, mental health, a sense of belonging, and more.

## ü©∫ Connect with Professionals
The professionals directory enables refugees to find healthcare, mental health and legal professionals who speak their language. Users can search for lawyers, doctors, psychologists, and counsellors based on their language and location within Metro Vancouver. The information provided for each professional includes their name, practice name, website, contact information, registration status, and more.

This feature aims to tackle the problem of language barrier faced by refugees in healthcare proven by studies, preventing them from seeking mental health support and more. This problem has a simple yet intuitive and effective solution.

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Embed Feature (Newcomer‚Äôs Map)
The Newcomer‚Äôs Map provides over 50 useful locations sorted into categories such as food banks, places of worship, libraries, and refugee support organizations. This feature helps refugees better understand their surroundings and find places that provide services and programs to help them with integration and resettlement.

## üì± Accessibility Features
Refugee Pal is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with numerous accessibility features. The app is available in many different languages using the Google Translate API provided through FlutterFlow and has an easy-to-navigate and minimal user interface. Refugee Pal was built with its users in mind, available in both IOS and Android devices. With the help of Firestore offline support, almost all of our features are offline accessible.

### üí¨ Q&A Chat Threads

The Q&A feature that allows refugees to post questions within different chats separated in the same categories as the digital resource hub and map feature. Settlement workers or other qualified professionals can reply to their questions, providing refugees with answers to their questions.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Refugee Pal for Helpers

Ever wondered how Refugee Pal gathers its database of services? We used to do this manually, but we realized that Refugee Pal needed to act as a bridge between refugees and refugee support organizations. With Refugee Pal for Helpers, helpers can post their services and programs on the platform, and professionals like doctors and lawyers can list their practice on the professionals directory. Finally, Refugee Pal comes with a separate chat client for settlement workers to communicate with refugees.
